## Summary
Based on our results, members of the Vine program are more likely to write positive reviews. To further support our findings, we performed an additional analysis on the other four ratings to see how the number of positive reviews compare to the negative ones. 

This is what we found:

- Vine reviews:

- Non-Vine reviews:

The number of negative reviews is extremely low and proves that our initial statement is correct.
